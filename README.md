# Ultimate Kana

Ultimate Kana is a mobile application for learning and reviewing the Japanese alphabet.
The goal of this project is to provide an app that:
* Introduces kana in easy to memorize lessons
* Easy to use review experience
* Ability to customize review sessions to individual learning styles, or focus on problem characters
* Fun games or alternate learning techniques for motivation

## Introduction

While learning Hiragana and Katakana, I found it useful to use mobile apps for practice. Mobile apps seems to be the most convenient platform for quick review and memorization. While there are several apps currently available for learning kana, they each have unique benefits and flaws. I set out to create a kana review app that would not only offer a simple and robust user experience, but also be highly customization to individual learning styles.

## Technology

This project uses the [Expo](https://expo.io/) framework. It is built on top of React Native, providing features for easy testing on mobile devices.

## Building

Please follow the official Expo instructions for [installation](https://docs.expo.io/get-star1ed/installation/)
Once Expo is installed, use `yarn` or `npm install` for dependencies and `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the Expo bundler. Follow the bundler instructions to launch the app on your iOS/Android device, or in a browser.
