# Ultimate Kana

## Introduction

> While learning Hiragana and Katakana, I found it useful to use mobile apps for practice. Mobile seems to be the best format for quick review and memorization. However, all the apps I found had unique benefits and flaws. I set out to create a kana review app that would not only offer a simple and robust user experience, but also be highly customization to individual learning styles.

## Installation

> Use `yarn` or `npm install` for dependencies and `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the Expo bundler.
